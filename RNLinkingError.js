This error occurs when you are using a library or component that relies on native modules, but the native modules aren't properly linked or installed. This is especially common in React Native when working with third-party libraries that require platform-specific code (Android and iOS).  The error message might not always explicitly mention linking, but its symptoms will point to a connection issue between the JavaScript and native sides of your app.
