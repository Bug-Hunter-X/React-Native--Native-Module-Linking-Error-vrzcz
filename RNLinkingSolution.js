To fix this, you need to ensure that the native modules for the problematic library are correctly linked. The exact process depends on the library and your development environment (Android Studio, Xcode).  Generally, involves running specific commands in your terminal to integrate native code. Check the library's documentation for the specific linking instructions. In some cases, you might need to re-install the library and run the link commands again.

Example (Illustrative, library-specific commands vary):

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean
cd ..
react-native link <library-name>
```

After linking, rebuild your app and verify if the error persists.
